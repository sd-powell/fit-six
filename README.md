## Introduction

**Fit Six** is a Django-based e-commerce website built to serve as the official online merch store for *Fit Six Gym*, a community-focused training space in South Wales. The site allows gym members and the wider public to browse, filter, and purchase branded apparel and accessories such as t-shirts, hoodies, shaker bottles, and more.

This project was developed as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Web Development Diploma. It demonstrates core skills in backend development, user authentication, responsive front-end design, and secure payment integration using Stripe.
