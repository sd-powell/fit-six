# Fit Six – Testing

> [!NOTE]  
> Return to the main [README.md](README.md) file.

This document outlines the testing strategy, process, and results for the **Fit Six Store** e-commerce application. It verifies that the site’s core functionality operates correctly across all user roles, provides a responsive and accessible experience, and meets the acceptance criteria defined by the project’s user stories and feature plan.

Both **manual and automated testing** were conducted throughout development, covering functionality, responsiveness, browser compatibility, accessibility, and data validation. Django’s built-in test framework was used for backend testing, while real-device and browser tools were used to assess front-end behaviour.

This file includes:
- ✅ User story-based test cases  
- ✅ Manual testing across devices and browsers  
- ✅ Automated unit tests (Django views, forms, models)  
- ✅ HTML, CSS, Python, and accessibility validation  
- ✅ Bug tracking and fixes  
- ✅ Known issues (if any)

Testing was an **essential part of the Fit Six development workflow**, ensuring that the application remained **robust, responsive, and user-friendly** at every stage. Continuous testing allowed issues to be identified and resolved early, improving both development efficiency and overall site reliability.

A range of tools and methods were employed to validate the site’s functionality and presentation. **Chrome Developer Tools** were used extensively to test responsiveness, inspect layout behaviour, debug JavaScript interactions, and assess performance under different viewport sizes. These tools proved invaluable for tuning the user experience across devices.

**ChatGPT** was used throughout the project to support testing strategies, clarify Django logic, refine user journeys, and improve the accessibility and clarity of interface elements. This assisted in building maintainable, production-ready code and supported critical thinking during test planning and debugging.

To confirm that the site was **responsive and accessible across all modern devices**, every page and interactive element was manually tested using Chrome’s responsive design mode, as well as physical testing on **desktop monitors, laptops, tablets, and smartphones**. Navigation, forms, and key e-commerce flows were verified at various screen sizes to ensure a **seamless and consistent experience** for all users.
